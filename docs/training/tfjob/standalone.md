# Submit a standalone tensorflow job

## Submit the job

Here is an example how you can use `arena` for the machine learning training. It will download the source code from the specified git url.

1. The first step is to check the available resources:

    ```txt
    $ arena top node
    NAME                       IPADDRESS      ROLE    STATUS  GPU(Total)  GPU(Allocated)
    cn-hongkong.192.168.2.107  47.242.51.160  <none>  Ready   0           0
    cn-hongkong.192.168.2.108  192.168.2.108  <none>  Ready   1           0
    cn-hongkong.192.168.2.109  192.168.2.109  <none>  Ready   1           0
    cn-hongkong.192.168.2.110  192.168.2.110  <none>  Ready   1           0
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Allocated/Total GPUs In Cluster:
    0/3 (0.0%)
    ```

    We can see that there are 3 available nodes with GPU resources for running training jobs.

2. Now we can submit a training job with `arena`, it will download the source code from github:

    ```txt
    $ arena \
      submit \
      tfjob \
      --gpus=1 \
      --name=tf-standalone-test-with-git \
      --env=TEST_TMPDIR=code/tensorflow-sample-code/ \
      --sync-mode=git \
      --sync-source=https://github.com/happy2048/tensorflow-sample-code.git \
      --logdir=/training_logs \
      --image="registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/ai-samples/tensorflow:1.5.0-devel-gpu" \
      "'python code/tensorflow-sample-code/tfjob/docker/mnist/main.py --max_steps 5000'"
    
    configmap/tf-git-tfjob created
    configmap/tf-git-tfjob labeled
    tfjob.kubeflow.org/tf-git created
    INFO[0000] The Job tf-git has been submitted successfully
    INFO[0000] You can run `arena get tf-git --type tfjob` to check the job status
    ```

!!! note

    If you cannot pull the image `registry.cn-beijing.aliyuncs.com/ai-samples/tensorflow:1.5.0-devel-gpu`, try another one `registry.cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/ai-samples/tensorflow:1.5.0-devel-gpu`.

descriptions:

* tfjob will execute the entrypoint command with `sh` by default, if you want to use `bash`, please specify the shell by using `--shell=bash`ã€‚
* The source code will be downloaded and extracted to the directory `code/` of the working directory. The default working directory is `/root`, you can also specify by using `--working-dir`. Also, you may specify the branch you are pulling code from by adding `--env GIT_SYNC_BRANCH=main` to the parameters while submitting the job.
* If you are using the private git repo, you can use the following command:

```bash
arena submit tf \
    --name=tf-git \
    --gpus=1 \
    --image=tensorflow/tensorflow:1.5.0-devel-gpu \
    --sync-mode=git \
    --sync-source=https://github.com/happy2048/tensorflow-sample-code.git \
    --env=GIT_SYNC_USERNAME=<GIT-USERNAME> \
    --env=GIT_SYNC_PASSWORD=<GIT-PASSWORD> \
    "python code/tensorflow-sample-code/tfjob/docker/mnist/main.py"
```

!!! note

    `arena` is using [git-sync](https://github.com/kubernetes/git-sync/blob/master/cmd/git-sync/main.go) to sync up source code. You can set the environment variables defined in git-sync project.

## List all tensorflow jobs

You can use `arena list --type tfjob` to list all tensorflow jobs:

```txt
$ arena list --type tfjob
NAME                         STATUS   TRAINER  DURATION  GPU(Requested)  GPU(Allocated)  NODE
tf-standalone-test-with-git  PENDING  TFJOB    3s        0               0               N/A
```

If you want to list all training jobs,you can use `arena list`:

```txt
$ arena list
NAME                         STATUS     TRAINER     DURATION  GPU(Requested)  GPU(Allocated)  NODE
tf-standalone-test-with-git  PENDING    TFJOB       5m        0               0               N/A
pytorch-test                 FAILED     PYTORCHJOB  10m       1               N/A             192.168.1.101
mpi-dist                     SUCCEEDED  MPIJOB      1m        0               N/A             192.168.1.100
```

## Get the tensorflow job detail information

If you want to get the job details, you can use `arena get`:

```txt
$ arena get tf-standalone-test-with-git
Name:        tf-standalone-test-with-git
Status:      PENDING
Namespace:   default
Priority:    N/A
Trainer:     TFJOB
Duration:    7m

Instances:
NAME                                 STATUS    AGE  IS_CHIEF  GPU(Requested)  NODE
----                                 ------    ---  --------  --------------  ----
tf-standalone-test-with-git-chief-0  Init:0/1  7m   true      0               N/A
```

## Get the tensorflow job logs

When the job status is running, use `arena logs` to get the job logs:

```txt
$ arena logs tf-standalone-test-with-git --tail 10
Accuracy at step 4920: 0.9828
Accuracy at step 4930: 0.9823
Accuracy at step 4940: 0.9827
Accuracy at step 4950: 0.9824
Accuracy at step 4960: 0.983
Accuracy at step 4970: 0.979
Accuracy at step 4980: 0.9821
Accuracy at step 4990: 0.9823
Adding run metadata for 4999
Total Train-accuracy=0.9823
```

In this case,we only display the last 10 lines of the logs.

## Get the logviewer

More information about the training job in the logviewer:

```txt
$ arena logviewer tf-standalone-test-with-git
Your LogViewer will be available on:
172.20.0.197:8080/tfjobs/ui/#/default/tf-standalone-test-with-git
```

## Delete the job

When the job is completed, use `arena delete` to delete the job:

```bash
arena delete tf-standalone-test-with-git
```

Congratulations! You've run the first training job with `arena` successfully.
